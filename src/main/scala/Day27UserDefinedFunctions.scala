  //Now that we’ve created these functions and tested them, we need to register them with Spark so
  //that we can use them on all of our worker machines. Spark will serialize the function on the
  //driver and transfer it over the network to all executor processes. This happens regardless of
  //language.
  //When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is
  //written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that
  //there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code
  //generation capabilities that Spark has for built-in functions.

  //we
  //need to register the function to make it available as a DataFrame function

  //so names are up to you, should be meaningful of course

  //At this juncture, we can use this only as a DataFrame function. That is to say, we can’t use it
  //within a string expression, only on an expression. However, we can also register this UDF as a
  //Spark SQL function. This is valuable because it makes it simple to use this function within SQL
  //as well as across languages.
  //Let’s register the function in Scala:

  // in Scala
  spark.udf.register("power3", power3(_:Double):Double)
  df.selectExpr("power3(num)").show(5)

  //lets register our other function with integers
